# The docs-as-code Manifesto

The "docs-as-code Manifesto", just like the [Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/), has been carefully worded to capture the essence of docs-as-code methodology in minimum words.

The *docs-as-code Manifesto* can be found [here](manifesto.md) and the *docs-as-code Best Practices* [here](best-practices.md).

> The documents are in `DRAFT` status.
