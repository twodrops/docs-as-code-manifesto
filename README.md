# The docs-as-code Manifesto

The [docs-as-code Manifesto](manifesto.md), just like the [Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/), has been carefully worded to capture the essence of docs-as-code methodology in minimum words.

The Manifesto can be found [here](manifesto.md)

> The document is in `DRAFT` status.
